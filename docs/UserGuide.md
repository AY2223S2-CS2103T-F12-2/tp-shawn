## Quick Start

### Download and Installation

Before you can use CoDoc, you need to download it. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have `Java 11` or above installed in your Computer. -> [How To Check Java Version](#how-to-check-java-version)
   * If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11)
2. Download the latest version of `codoc.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.3.trial).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for CoDoc.<br>
   For example,
   1. Create a new folder in your Desktop—this folder will then be the _home folder_.
   2. Place `codoc.jar` into the newly created folder.
4. Open a command terminal -> [How to Open CoDoc](#how-to-open-codoc)
   1. `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in.
   2. `java -jar codoc.jar` to run the application.<br>
   3. A window similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds.

      <img src="images/Ui-minimised.png"/>
      <br>

### Navigation

Before we begin, let's familiarize ourselves with the different parts of the CoDoc interface.
Maximise the screen to have a clearer view.
This way you can see more content as well.

<img src="images/navigation.png"/>

- **Menu Bar:** if you ever feel stuck, you can always click on the `Help` button here or enter `help` in the command box. 
- **Command Box:** this is where you can type in commands.
- **Result Display:** shows the result of a command that you have executed.
- **Person List Panel:** here are your contacts in CoDoc.
- **Course List Panel:** you can refer to this list when adding a person.
- **Info Panel:** displays information about a selected person, such as their contact details, modules, and skills, which are presented as tabs.

[Scroll back to *Table of Contents*](#table-of-contents)

### Tutorial

Now that you know how to navigate CoDoc, let's start by adding a person to our contact list! To do this, follow these steps:

#### 1. Adding a person

Let's start by adding a person named Bob, a year 2 student taking Computer Science with the email e0823741@nus.edu. 

Enter the command `add n/Bob y/2 c/6 e/e0823741@nus.edu` into the command box. This will add a new person named Bob to our contact list. 

**Note:** You must specify minimally, the person's _name_, _email_, _year_ and _course_ when adding a person.

As you can see, we first specify the `add` command followed by the _name prefix_ `n/` and the _name_ that we want to add i.e. `Bob`. Same goes for the _year_, _course_ and _email_. 

**Note:** The person's _course_ corresponds to its index in the course list panel.

Here we used `c/6`, because if you look at the course list panel on the left, Computer Science refers to index `6`. 

If you want to, you can add other details of the person such as his/her _GitHub username_, _LinkedIn profile URL_, _modules_ and _skills_.

Related docs: [Adding a person: `add`](#adding-a-person--add)

If you followed the steps above correctly, you would see Bob added at the bottom of the person list panel:

<img src="images/tutorial/adding-bob.png"/>

**Note:** Your profile pictures and the profile pictures shown here might not be exactly the same as they are randomised.

#### 2. Viewing a person's modules

To view Bob in the right info panel, enter `view 8`.
His _contact_ details will then be shown in the info panel, under the _contact_ tab. We use `8` here because Bob's index is 8 in the person list panel.

**Note:** The specified index used with the `view` command must correspond to the index of the person that you want to `view` in the person list panel.

Now let's change to his _modules_ tab: enter `view m` in the command box.
As shown below, he does not have any _modules_ currently.

<img src="images/tutorial/viewing-bobs-modules.png"/>

You can enter `view s` as well if you want to see Bob's _skills_. You can also view other contacts by specifying the person's index in the list i.e. `view 2` would load Nicole Lee in the info panel.

💡 **Tip:** Alternatively, you can also click on Bob's name in the _Person List Panel_ to bring up his information onto the _Info Panel_.

**Related docs:** [Viewing a person/Changing tabs: `view`](#viewing-a-personchanging-tabs--view)

#### 3. Editing a person's modules

To update Bob's module list to have let's say CS2101 and CS2103T, first make sure that Bob is shown in the right info panel, by entering `view 8`. 

Then enter `edit m/ay2223s2 cs2101 m/ay2223s2 cs2103t` in the command box. 

**Note:** Editing only works on the person shown in the info panel. If the person you want to edit is not shown in the info panel, you have to use the `view` command first to view that person, then edit as you wish. Also, _modules_ must follow a certain format to be successfully added/edited.

**Related docs:** [Viewing a person/Changing tabs: `view`](#viewing-a-personchanging-tabs--view), [Editing a person: `edit`](#editing-a-person--edit)

Bob's updated module list (enter `view m` if you're not on the _modules_ tab) would look like this after you entered the `edit` command:

<img src="images/tutorial/editing-bobs-modules.png"/>

You might be thinking why not we just add Bob's _modules_ in the first place when adding him? You can do that! But for this tutorial, we have separated it to show how you can use the `edit` command. 

You can also edit other details of the person such as his/her _name_, _year_, _GitHub username_, etc., not just their _modules_.

**Related docs:** [Adding a person: `add`](#adding-a-person--add), [Editing a person: `edit`](#editing-a-person--edit)

#### 4. Finding a person by their modules

Let's try to find contacts that are taking/have taken CS2103T. First, let's reset all existing filters if they have been applied. We can do this by entering `list`. This shows us all the contacts in CoDoc. 

Then enter `find m/cs2103t`. This would show the contacts in the person list panel that have CS2103T in their module list:

<img src="images/tutorial/finding-cs2103t.png"/>

Here, if you followed the previous steps correctly, Bob would be shown as well.

Our `find` command is pretty powerful; it works for other attributes, like _year_, _skills_, etc. and you can find by multiple attributes. To learn more about it, you can take a look at [Finding a person: `find`](#finding-a-person--find)

**Related docs:** [Finding a person: `find`](#finding-a-person--find), [Listing all persons/Resetting filters: `list`](#listing-all-personsresetting-filters--list)

**Congrats! You have completed the tutorial 🎉** 

The pre-existing contacts are just some examples that you can play around with, but if you want to start with a fresh contact list, enter `clear` to clear all contacts. 

Lastly, if you need more info on the usage of each command, you can refer to the relevant sections below.

### Viewing a person/Changing tabs : `view`

Controls the what is displayed in the right panel. 

If an `integer` is specified, the person displayed on the right will be the person in the person list that has the **same index** as the integer given.

If `c` is specified, the tab on the right will switch to the **contact information**.

If `m` is specified, the tab on the right will switch to the **modules taken**.

If `s` is specified, the tab on the right will switch to the **skills** that the person has.

`view <PARAMETERS>`<br>
